## Technical 
* I chose to use Ruby on Rails with Action Cable. Deployed using Heroku. 
* The job I have lined up will require me to use Ruby on Rails, which was my primary reason for choosing the framework for my project. Ruby is also my favorite programming language so far. 
* Action Cable is fairly new and therefore had little documentation. This made it harder to find troubleshooting tips. I'm curious to see how documentation develops over time. 
* Used request specs instead of controller specs.  
* If I had more time I would add sign-out functionality, ensure authorization is performed correctly, add a cross-out visual for completed items, etc.
